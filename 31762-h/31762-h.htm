	<p>This story contains what is, to us, at any rate, a novel idea—that when we
	of Earth finally reach Mars we may find there records of prehistoric Earth
	far surpassing those of our paleontologists. Or, in other words, that creatures
	of Mars may have visited this planet tens of thousands of years ago and
	returned home with specimens for their science. A nice idea well told.</p>

	<h1>THE
	RECORD
	OF
	CURRUPIRA</h1>
	<p id="author">by … Robert Abernathy</p>
	<p id="prolog">From ancient Martian records came
	the grim song of a creature whose
	very existence was long forgotten.</p>
</div>
<div id="story">
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">James Dalton</span> strode briskly
	through the main exhibit room of
	New York’s Martian Museum,
	hardly glancing to right or left
	though many displays had been
	added since his last visit. The
	rockets were coming home regularly
	now and their most valuable
	cargoes—at least from a scientist’s
	point of view—were the relics of
	an alien civilization brought to
	light by the archeologists excavating
	the great dead cities.</p>

	<p>One new exhibit did catch Dalton’s
	eye. He paused to read the
	label with interest—</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="headline">MAN FROM MARS:</p>

		<p>The body here preserved was
		found December 12, 2001, by an
		exploring party from the spaceship
		<em>NEVADA</em>, in the Martian city
		which we designate E-3. It rested
		in a case much like this, in a
		building that had evidently been
		the municipal museum. Around
		it, in other cases likewise undisturbed
		since a period estimated at
		fifty thousand years ago, were a
		number of Earthly artifacts. These
		finds prove beyond doubt that a
		Martian scientific expedition
		visited Earth before the dawn of
		our history.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a>
	On the label someone had
	painstakingly copied the Martian
	glyphs found on the mummy’s
	original case. Dalton’s eyes traced
	the looping ornamental script—he
	was one of the very few men
	who had put in the years of work
	necessary to read inscriptional
	Martian—and he smiled appreciation
	of a jest that had taken fifty
	thousand years to ripen—the
	writing said simply, <em>Man From
	Earth</em>.</p>

	<p>The mummy lying on a sculptured
	catafalque beyond the glass
	was amazingly well preserved—far
	more lifelike and immensely
	older than anything Egypt had
	yielded. Long-dead Martian embalmers
	had done a good job
	even on what to them was the
	corpse of an other-world monster.</p>

	<p>He had been a small wiry man.
	His skin was dark though its
	color might have been affected
	by mummification. His features
	suggested those of the Forest
	Indian. Beside him lay his flaked-stone
	ax, his bone-pointed spear
	and spear thrower, likewise preserved
	by a marvelous chemistry.</p>

	<p>Looking down at that ancient
	nameless ancestor, Dalton was
	moved to solemn thoughts. This
	creature had been first of all human-kind
	to make the tremendous
	crossing to Mars—had seen its
	lost race in living glory, had died
	there and became a museum exhibit
	for the multiple eyes of wise
	grey spiderish aliens.</p>

	<p>“Interested in Oswald, sir?”</p>

	<p>Dalton glanced up and saw an
	attendant. “I was just thinking—if
	he could only talk! He does
	have a name, then?”</p>

	<p>The guard grinned. “Well, we
	call him Oswald. Sort of inconvenient,
	not having a name. When
	I worked at the Metropolitan we
	used to call all the Pharaohs and
	Assyrian kings by their first
	names.”</p>

	<p>Dalton mentally classified
	another example of the deep human
	need for verbal handles to
	lift unwieldy chunks of environment.
	The professional thought
	recalled him to business and he
	glanced at his watch.</p>

	<p>“I’m supposed to meet Dr.
	Oliver Thwaite here this morning.
	Has he come in yet?”</p>

	<p>“The archeologist? He’s here
	early and late when he’s on Earth.
	He’ll be up in the cataloguing department
	now. Want me to show
	you—”</p>

	<p>“I know the way,” said Dalton.
	“Thanks all the same.” He left
	the elevator at the fourth floor
	and impatiently pushed open the
	main cataloguing room’s glazed
	door.</p>

	<p>Inside cabinets and broad tables
	bore a wilderness of strange
	artifacts, many still crusted with
	red Martian sand. Alone in the
	room a trim-mustached man in a
	rough open-throated shirt looked
	up from an object he had been
	cleaning with a soft brush.</p>

	<p>“Dr. Thwaite? I’m Jim Dalton.”</p>

	<p>“Glad to meet you, Professor.”
	Thwaite carefully laid down his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>work, then rose to grip the
	visitor’s hand. “You didn’t lose
	any time.”</p>

	<p>“After you called last night I
	managed to get a seat on the
	dawn-rocket out of Chicago. I
	hope I’m not interrupting?”</p>

	<p>“Not at all. I’ve got some assistants
	coming in around nine. I
	was just going over some stuff I
	don’t like to trust to their thumb-fingered
	mercies.”</p>

	<p>Dalton looked down at the
	thing the archeologist had been
	brushing. It was a reed syrinx,
	the Pan’s pipes of antiquity.
	“That’s not a very Martian-looking
	specimen,” he commented.</p>

	<p>“The Martians, not having any
	lips, could hardly have had much
	use for it,” said Thwaite. “This is
	of Earthly manufacture—one of
	the Martians’ specimens from
	Earth, kept intact over all this
	time by a preservative I wish we
	knew how to make. It’s a nice
	find, man’s earliest known musical
	instrument—hardly as interesting
	as the record though.”</p>

	<p>Dalton’s eyes brightened. “Have
	you listened to the record yet?”</p>

	<p>“No. We got the machine
	working last night and ran off
	some of the Martian stuff. Clear
	as a bell. But I saved the main
	attraction for when you got here.”
	Thwaite turned to a side door,
	fishing a key from his pocket.
	“The playback machine’s in here.”</p>

	<p>The apparatus, squatting on a
	sturdy table in the small room
	beyond, had the slightly haywire
	look of an experimental model.
	But it was little short of a miracle
	to those who knew how it had
	been built—on the basis of
	radioed descriptions of the ruined
	device the excavators had dug up
	on Mars.</p>

	<p>Even more intriguing, however,
	was the row of neatly labeled
	boxes on a shelf. There in
	cushioned nests reposed little
	cylinders of age-tarnished metal,
	on which a close observer could
	still trace the faint engraved lines
	and whorls of Martian script.
	These were the best-preserved
	specimens yet found of Martian
	record films.</p>

	<p>Sound and pictures were on
	them, impressed there by a triumphant
	science so long ago that
	the code of Hammurabi or the
	hieroglyphs of Khufu seemed by
	comparison like yesterday’s newspaper.
	Men of Earth were ready
	now to evoke these ancient voices—but
	to reproduce the stereoscopic
	images was still beyond
	human technology.</p>

	<p>Dalton scrutinized one label
	intently. “Odd,” he said. “I realize
	how much the Martian archives
	may have to offer us when we
	master their spoken language—but
	I still want most to hear <em>this</em>
	record, the one the Martians made
	right here on Earth.”</p>

	<p>Thwaite nodded comprehendingly.
	“The human race is a good
	deal like an amnesia patient that
	wakes up at the age of forty and
	finds himself with a fairly prosperous
	business, a wife and
	children and a mortgage, but no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"> </a>recollection of his youth or infancy—and
	nobody around to tell
	him how he got where he is.</p>

	<p>“We invented writing so doggone
	late in the game. Now we
	get to Mars and find the people
	there knew us before we knew
	ourselves—but they died or
	maybe picked up and went, leaving
	just this behind.” He used
	both hands to lift the precious
	gray cylinder from its box. “And
	of course you linguists in particular
	get a big charge out of
	this discovery.”</p>

	<p>“<em>If</em> it’s a record of human
	speech it’ll be the oldest ever
	found. It may do for comparative-historical
	linguistics what the
	Rosetta Stone did for Egyptology.”
	Dalton grinned boyishly.
	“Some of us even nurse the hope
	it may do something for our old
	headache—the problem of the
	origin of language. That was one
	of the most important, maybe <em>the</em>
	most important step in human
	progress—and we don’t know
	how or when or why!”</p>

	<p>“I’ve heard of the bowwow
	theory and the dingdong theory,”
	said Thwaite, his hands busy with
	the machine.</p>

	<p>“Pure speculations. The plain
	fact is we haven’t even been able
	to make an informed guess because
	the evidence, the written
	records, only run back about six
	thousand years. That racial amnesia
	you spoke of.</p>

	<p>“Personally, I have a weakness
	for the magical theory—that man
	invented language in the search
	for magic formulae, words of
	power. Unlike the other theories,
	that one assumes as the motive
	force not merely passive imitativeness
	but an outgoing will.</p>

	<p>“Even the speechless subman
	must have observed that he could
	affect the behavior of animals of
	his own and other species by
	making appropriate noises—a
	mating call or a terrifying shout,
	for instance. Hence the perennial
	conviction you can get what you
	want if you just hold your mouth
	right, <em>and</em> you know the proper
	prayers or curses.”</p>

	<p>“A logical conclusion from
	the animistic viewpoint,” said
	Thwaite. He frowned over the
	delicate task of starting the film,
	inquired offhandedly, “You got
	the photostat of the label inscription?
	What did you make of
	it?”</p>

	<p>“Not much more than Henderson
	did on Mars. There’s the date
	of the recording and the place—the
	longitude doesn’t mean anything
	to us because we still don’t
	know where the Martians fixed
	their zero meridian. But it was
	near the equator and, the text indicates,
	in a tropical forest—probably
	in Africa or South
	America.</p>

	<p>“Then there’s the sentence Henderson
	couldn’t make out. It’s
	obscure and rather badly defaced,
	but it’s evidently a comment—unfavorable—on
	the subject-matter
	of the recording. In it appears
	twice a sort of interjection-adverb
	that in other contexts implies
	<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"> </a>revulsion—something like <em>ugh!</em>”</p>

	<p>“Funny. Looks like the Martians
	saw something on Earth
	they didn’t like. Too bad we
	can’t reproduce the visual record
	yet.”</p>

	<p>Dalton said soberly, “The Martian’s
	vocabulary indicates that
	for all their physical difference
	from us they had emotions very
	much like human beings’. Whatever
	they saw must have been
	something we wouldn’t have liked
	either.”</p>

	<p>The reproducer hummed softly.
	Thwaite closed the motor switch
	and the ancient film slid smoothly
	from its casing. Out of the speaker
	burst a strange medley of whirrings,
	clicks, chirps, trills and
	modulated drones and buzzings—a
	sound like the voice of grasshoppers
	in a drought-stricken field
	of summer.</p>

	<p>Dalton listened raptly, as if by
	sheer concentration he might even
	now be able to guess at connections
	between the sounds of
	spoken Martian—heard now for
	the first time—and the written
	symbols that he had been working
	over for years. But he couldn’t,
	of course—that would require a
	painstaking correlation analysis.</p>

	<p>“Evidently it’s an introduction
	or commentary,” said the archeologist.
	“Our photocell examination
	showed the wave-patterns of
	the initial and final portions of the
	film were typically Martian—but
	the middle part isn’t. The middle
	part is whatever they recorded
	here on Earth.”</p>

	<p>“If only that last part is a
	translation….” said Dalton hopefully.
	Then the alien susurration
	ceased coming from the reproducer
	and he closed his mouth
	abruptly and leaned forward.</p>

	<p>For the space of a caught
	breath there was silence. Then
	another voice came in, the voice
	of Earth hundreds of centuries
	dead.</p>

	<p>It was not human. No more
	than the first had been—but the
	Martian sounds had been merely
	alien and these were horrible.</p>

	<p>It was like nothing so much as
	the croaking of some gigantic
	frog, risen bellowing from a bottomless
	primeval swamp. It bayed
	of stinking sunless pools and
	gurgled of black ooze. And its
	booming notes descended to subsonic
	throbbings that gripped and
	wrung the nerves to anguish.</p>

	<p>Dalton was involuntarily on his
	feet, clawing for the switch. But
	he stopped, reeling. His head
	spun and he could not see.
	Through his dizzy brain the great
	voice roared and the mighty tones
	below hearing hammered at the
	inmost fortress of the man’s will.</p>

	<p>On the heels of that deafening
	assault the voice began to change.
	The numbing thunder rumbled
	back, repeating the pain and the
	threat—but underneath something
	crooned and wheedled obscenely.
	It said, “<em>Come … come … come….</em>”
	And the stunned
	prey came on stumbling feet,
	shivering with a terror that could
	not break the spell.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>
	Where the squat black machine
	had been was something that was
	also squat and black and huge.
	It crouched motionless and blind
	in the mud and from its pulsing
	expanded throat vibrated the
	demonic croaking. As the victim
	swayed helplessly nearer the
	mouth opened wide upon long
	rows of frightful teeth….</p>

	<p>The monstrous song stopped
	suddenly. Then still another voice
	cried briefly, thinly in agony and
	despair. That voice was human.</p>

	<p>Each of the two men looked
	into a white strange face. They
	were standing on opposite sides of
	the table and between them the
	playback machine had fallen
	silent. Then it began to whir again
	in the locust speech of the Martian
	commentator, explaining
	rapidly, unintelligibly.</p>

	<p>Thwaite found the switch with
	wooden fingers. As if with one
	accord they retreated from the
	black machine. Neither of them
	even tried to make a false show
	of self-possession. Each knew,
	from his first glimpse of the
	other’s dilated staring eyes, that
	both had experienced and seen
	the same.</p>

	<p>Dalton sank shivering into a
	chair, the darkness still swirling
	threateningly in his brain. Presently
	he said, “The expression of
	a will—that much was true. But
	the will—was not of man.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">James Dalton took a vacation.
	After a few days he went to a
	psychiatrist, who observed the
	usual symptoms of overwork and
	worry and recommended a change
	of scene—a rest in the country.</p>

	<p>On the first night at a friend’s
	secluded farm Dalton awoke
	drenched in cold sweat. Through
	the open window from not far
	away came a hellish serenade, the
	noise of frogs—the high nervous
	voices of peepers punctuating the
	deep leisured booming of bullfrogs.</p>

	<p>The linguist flung on his clothes
	and drove back at reckless speed
	to where there were lights and
	the noises of men and their
	machines. He spent the rest of
	his vacation burrowing under the
	clamor of the city whose steel and
	pavements proclaimed man’s victory
	over the very grass that grew.</p>

	<p>After awhile he felt better and
	needed work again. He took up
	his planned study of the Martian
	recordings, correlating the spoken
	words with the written ones he
	had already arduously learned to
	read.</p>

	<p>The Martian Museum readily
	lent him the recordings he requested
	for use in his work, including
	the one made on Earth.
	He studied the Martian-language
	portion of this and succeeded in
	making a partial translation—but
	carefully refrained from playing
	the middle section of the film
	back again.</p>

	<p>Came a day, though, when it
	occurred to him that he had
	heard not a word from Thwaite.
	He made inquiries through the
	Museum and learned that the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>archeologist had applied for a
	leave of absence and left before
	it was granted. Gone where? The
	Museum people didn’t know—but
	Thwaite had not been trying to
	cover his trail. A call to Global
	Air Transport brought the desired
	information.</p>

	<p>A premonition ran up Dalton’s
	spine—but he was surprised at
	how calmly he thought and acted.
	He picked up the phone and
	called Transport again—this time
	their booking department.</p>

	<p>“When’s the earliest time I can
	get passage to Belem?” he asked.</p>

	<p>With no more than an hour to
	pack and catch the rocket he hurried
	to the Museum. The place
	was more or less populated with
	sightseers, which was annoying,
	because Dalton’s plans now included larceny.</p>

	<p>He waited before the building
	till the coast was clear, then, with
	handkerchief-wrapped knuckles,
	broke the glass and tripped the
	lever on the fire alarm. In minutes
	a wail of sirens and roar of arriving
	motors was satisfyingly loud
	in the main exhibit room. Police
	and fire department helicopters
	buzzed overhead. A wave of
	mingled fright and curiosity swept
	visitors and attendants alike to
	the doors.</p>

	<p>Dalton, lingering, found himself
	watched only by the millennially
	sightless eyes of the man
	who lay in state in an airless glass
	tomb. The stern face was inscrutable
	behind the silence of
	many thousand years.</p>

	<p>“Excuse me, Oswald,” murmured
	Dalton. “I’d like to borrow
	something of yours but I’m
	sure you won’t mind.”</p>

	<p>The reed flute was in a long
	case devoted to Earthly specimens.
	Unhesitatingly Dalton smashed
	the glass.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Brazil is a vast country, and it
	cost much trouble and time and
	expense before Dalton caught up
	with Thwaite in a forlorn riverbank
	town along the line where
	civilization hesitates on the shore
	of that vast sea of vegetation
	called the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mato</em>. Night had just
	fallen when Dalton arrived. He
	found Thwaite alone in a lighted
	room of the single drab hotel—alone
	and very busy.</p>

	<p>The archeologist was shaggily
	unshaven. He looked up and said
	something that might have been a
	greeting devoid of surprise. Dalton
	grimaced apologetically, set
	down his suitcase and pried the
	wax plugs out of his ears, explaining
	with a gesture that included
	the world outside, where
	the tree frogs sang deafeningly in
	the hot stirring darkness of the
	near forest.</p>

	<p>“How do you stand it?” he
	asked.</p>

	<p>Thwaite’s lips drew back from
	his teeth. “I’m fighting it,” he
	said shortly, picking up his work
	again. On the bed where he sat
	were scattered steel cartridge
	clips. He was going through them
	with a small file, carefully cutting
	a deep cross in the soft nose of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>every bullet. Nearby a heavy-caliber
	rifle leaned against a wardrobe.
	Other things were in evidence—boots,
	canteens, knapsacks,
	the tough clothing a man
	needs in the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mato</em>.</p>

	<p>“You’re looking for <em>it</em>.”</p>

	<p>Thwaite’s eyes burned feverishly.
	“Yes. Do you think I’m
	crazy?”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Dalton pulled a rickety chair
	toward him and sat down straddling
	it. “I don’t know,” he said
	slowly. “<em>It</em> was very likely a
	creature of the last interglacial
	period. The ice may have finished
	its kind.”</p>

	<p>“The ice never touched these
	equatorial forests.” Thwaite
	smiled unpleasantly. “And the
	Indians and old settlers down here
	have stories—about a thing that
	calls in the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mato</em>, that can paralyze
	a man with fear. <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Currupira</em>
	is their name for it.</p>

	<p>“When I remembered those
	stories they fell into place alongside
	a lot of others from different
	countries and times—the Sirens,
	for instance, and the Lorelei.
	Those legends are ancient. But
	perhaps here in the Amazon basin,
	in the forests that have never been
	cut and the swamps that have
	never been drained, the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">currupira</em>
	is still real and alive. I <em>hope</em> so!”</p>

	<p>“Why?”</p>

	<p>“I want to meet it. I want to
	show it that men can destroy it
	with all its unholy power.”
	Thwaite bore down viciously on
	the file and the bright flakes of
	lead glittered to the floor beside
	his feet.</p>

	<p>Dalton watched him with eyes
	of compassion. He heard the frog
	music swelling outside, a harrowing
	reminder of ultimate blasphemous
	insult, and he felt the
	futility of argument.</p>

	<p>“Remember, I heard it too,”
	Dalton said. “And I sensed what
	you did. That voice or some combination
	of frequencies or overtones
	within it, is resonant to the
	essence of evil—the fundamental
	life-hating self-destroying evil in
	man—even to have glimpsed it,
	to have heard the brainless beast
	mocking, was an outrage to humanity
	that a man must….”</p>

	<p>Dalton paused, got a grip on
	himself. “But, consider—the outrage
	was wiped out, humanity
	won its victory over the monster
	a long time ago. What if it isn’t
	quite extinct? That record was
	fifty thousand years old.”</p>

	<p>“What did you do with the
	record?” Thwaite looked up
	sharply.</p>

	<p>“I obliterated that—the voice
	and the pictures that went with
	it from the film before I returned
	it to the Museum.”</p>

	<p>Thwaite sighed deeply. “Good.
	I was damning myself for not
	doing that before I left.”</p>

	<p>The linguist said, “I think it
	answered my question as much as
	I want it answered. The origin
	of speech—lies in the will to
	power, the lust to dominate other
	men by preying on the weakness
	or evil in them.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"> </a>
	“Those first men didn’t just
	guess that such power existed—they
	<em>knew</em> because the beast had
	taught them and they tried to
	imitate it—the mystagogues and
	tyrants through the ages, with
	voices, with tomtoms and bull-roarers
	and trumpets. What makes
	the memory of that voice so hard
	to live with is just knowing that
	what it called to is a part of man—isn’t
	that it?”</p>

	<p>Thwaite didn’t answer. He had
	taken the heavy rifle across his
	knees and was methodically testing
	the movement of the well-oiled
	breech mechanism.</p>

	<p>Dalton stood up wearily and
	picked up his suitcase. “I’ll check
	into the hotel. Suppose we talk
	this over some more in the morning.
	Maybe things’ll look different
	by daylight.”</p>

	<p>But in the morning Thwaite
	was gone—upriver with a hired
	boatman, said the natives. The
	note he had left said only, <em>Sorry.
	But it’s no use talking about
	humanity—this is personal.</em></p>

	<p>Dalton crushed the note angrily,
	muttering under his breath, “The
	fool! Didn’t he realize I’d go with
	him?” He hurled the crumpled
	paper aside and stalked out to
	look for a guide.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">They chugged slowly westward
	up the forest-walled river, an
	obscure tributary that flowed
	somewhere into the Xingú. After
	four days, they had hopes of being
	close on the others’ track. The
	brown-faced guide, Joao, who
	held the tiller now, was a magician.
	He had conjured up an ancient
	outboard motor for the scow-like
	boat Dalton had bought from a
	fisherman.</p>

	<p>The sun was setting murkily
	and the sluggish swell of the
	water ahead was the color of
	witch’s blood. Under its opaque
	surface <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">a mae dágua</em>, the Mother
	of Water, ruled over creatures
	slimy and razor-toothed. In the
	blackness beneath the great trees,
	where it was dark even at noon,
	other beings had their kingdom.</p>

	<p>Out of the forest came the crying
	grunting hooting voices of its
	life that woke at nightfall, fiercer
	and more feverish than that of the
	daytime. To the man from the
	north there seemed something indecent
	in the fertile febrile swarming
	of life here. Compared to a
	temperate woodland the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mato</em> was
	like a metropolis against a sleepy
	village.</p>

	<p>“What’s that?” Dalton demanded
	sharply as a particularly
	hideous squawk floated across the
	water.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Nao é nada. A bicharia agitase.</em>”
	Joao shrugged. “The menagerie
	agitates itself.” His manner
	indicated that some <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">bichinho</em>
	beneath notice had made the
	noise.</p>

	<p>But moments later the little
	brown man became rigid. He
	half rose to his feet in the boat’s
	stern, then stooped and shut off
	the popping motor. In the relative
	silence the other heard what he
	had—far off and indistinct, muttering
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>deep in the black <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mato</em>, a
	voice that croaked of ravenous
	hunger in accents abominably
	known to him.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Currupira</em>,” said Joao tensely.
	“<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Currupira sai á caçada da noite.</em>”
	He watched the foreigner with
	eyes that gleamed in the fading
	light like polished onyx.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Avante!</em>” snapped Dalton.
	“See if it comes closer to the river
	this time.”</p>

	<p>It was not the first time they
	had heard that voice calling since
	they had ventured deep into the
	unpeopled swampland about
	which the downriver settlements
	had fearful stories to whisper.</p>

	<p>Silently the guide spun the
	engine. The boat sputtered on.
	Dalton strained his eyes, watching
	the darkening shore as he had
	watched fruitlessly for so many
	miles.</p>

	<p>But now, as they rounded a
	gentle bend, he glimpsed a small
	reddish spark near the bank.
	Then, by the last glimmer of the
	swiftly fading twilight, he made
	out a boat pulled up under gnarled
	tree-roots. That was all he could
	see but the movement of the red
	spark told him a man was sitting
	in the boat, smoking a cigarette.</p>

	<p>“In there,” he ordered in a low
	voice but Joao had seen already
	and was steering toward the shore.</p>

	<p>The cigarette arched into the
	water and hissed out and they
	heard a scuffling and lap of water
	as the other boat swayed, which
	meant that the man in it had
	stood up.</p>

	<p>He sprang into visibility as a
	flashlight in Dalton’s hand went
	on. A squat, swarthy man with
	rugged features, a <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">caboclo</em>, of
	white and Indian blood. He
	blinked expressionlessly at the
	light.</p>

	<p>“Where is the American scientist?”
	demanded Dalton in Portuguese.</p>

	<p>“<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Quem sabe? Foi-se.</em>”</p>

	<p>“Which way did he go?”</p>

	<p>“<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Nao importa. O doutor é
	doido; nao ha-de-voltar</em>,” said
	the man suddenly. “It doesn’t
	matter. The doctor is crazy—he
	won’t come back.”</p>

	<p>“Answer me, damn it! Which
	way?”</p>

	<p>The <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">caboclo</em> jerked his shoulders
	nervously and pointed.</p>

	<p>“Come on!” said Dalton and
	scrambled ashore even as Joao
	was stopping the motor and
	making the boat fast beside the
	other. “He’s gone in after it!”</p>

	<p>The forest was a black labyrinth.
	Its tangled darkness seemed
	to drink up the beam of the
	powerful flashlight Dalton had
	brought, its uneasy rustlings and
	animal-noises pressed in to swallow
	the sound of human movements
	for which he strained his
	ears, fearing to call out. He
	pushed forward recklessly, carried
	on by a sort of inertia of determination;
	behind him Joao followed,
	though he moved woodenly
	and muttered prayers under his
	breath.</p>

	<p>Then somewhere very near a
	great voice croaked briefly and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>was silent—so close that it poured
	a wave of faintness over the
	hearer, seemed to send numbing
	electricity tingling along his motor
	nerves.</p>

	<p>Joao dropped to his knees and
	flung both arms about a tree-bole.
	His brown face when the
	light fell on it was shiny with
	sweat, his eyes dilated and blind-looking.
	Dalton slammed the heel
	of his hand against the man’s
	shoulder and got no response
	save for a tightening of the grip
	on the treetrunk, and a pitiful
	whimper, “<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Assombra-me</em>—it overshadows
	me!”</p>

	<p>Dalton swung the flashlight
	beam ahead and saw nothing.
	Then all at once, not fifty yards
	away, a single glowing eye sprang
	out of the darkness, arched
	through the air and hit the ground
	to blaze into searing brilliance and
	white smoke. The clearing in
	which it burned grew bright as
	day, and Dalton saw a silhouetted
	figure clutching a rifle and turning
	its head from side to side.</p>

	<p>He plunged headlong toward
	the light of the flare, shouting,
	“Thwaite, you idiot! You can’t—”</p>

	<p>And then the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">currupira</em> spoke.</p>

	<p>Its bellowing seemed to come
	from all around, from the ground,
	the trees, the air. It smote like a
	blow in the stomach that drives
	out wind and fight. And it roared
	on, lashing at the wills of those
	who heard it, beating and stamping
	them out like sparks of a
	scattered fire.</p>

	<p>Dalton groped with one hand
	for his pocket but his hand kept
	slipping away into a matterless
	void as his vision threatened to
	slip into blindness. Dimly he saw
	Thwaite, a stone’s throw ahead of
	him, start to lift his weapon and
	then stand frozen, swaying a little
	on his feet as if buffeted by waves
	of sound.</p>

	<p>Already the second theme was
	coming in—the insidious obbligato
	of invitation to death,
	wheedling that <em>this way … this
	way …</em> was the path from the
	torment and terror that the monstrous
	voice flooded over them.</p>

	<p>Thwaite took a stiff step, then
	another and another, toward the
	black wall of the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">mato</em> that rose
	beyond the clearing. With an indescribable
	shudder Dalton realized
	that he too had moved an
	involuntary step forward. The
	<em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">currupira’s</em> voice rose triumphantly.</p>

	<p>With a mighty effort of will
	Dalton closed fingers he could not
	feel on the object in his pocket.
	Like a man lifting a mountain he
	lifted it to his lips.</p>

	<p>A high sweet note cut like a
	knife through the roll of nightmare
	drums. With terrible concentration
	Dalton shifted his
	fingers and blew and blew….</p>

	<p>Piercing and lingering, the
	tones of the pipes flowed into his
	veins, tingling, warring with the
	numbing poison of the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">currupira’s</em>
	song.</p>

	<p>Dalton was no musician but it
	seemed to him then that an ancestral
	instinct was with him, guiding
	<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>his breath and his fingers. The
	powers of the monster were darkness
	and cold and weariness of
	living, the death-urge recoiling
	from life into nothingness.</p>

	<p>But the powers of the pipes
	were life and light and warmth,
	life returning when the winter is
	gone, greenness and laughter and
	love. Life was in them, life of
	men dead these thousand generations,
	life even of the craftsmen
	on an alien planet who had preserved
	their form and their meaning
	for this moment.</p>

	<p>Dalton advanced of his own
	will until he stood beside Thwaite—but
	the other remained unstirring
	and Dalton did not dare
	pause for a moment, while the
	monster yet bellowed in the blackness
	before them. The light of the
	flare was reddening, dying….</p>

	<p>After a seeming eternity he
	saw motion, saw the rifle muzzle
	swing up. The shot was deafening
	in his ear, but it was an immeasurable
	relief. As it echoed
	the <em lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">currupira’s</em> voice was abruptly
	silent. In the bushes ahead there
	was a rending of branches, a
	frantic slithering movement of a
	huge body.</p>

	<p>They followed the noises in a
	sort of frenzy, plunging toward
	them heedless of thorns and whipping
	branches. The flashlight
	stabbed and revealed nothing. Out
	of the shadows a bass croaking
	came again, and Thwaite fired
	twice at the sound and there was
	silence save for a renewed flurry
	of cracking twigs.</p>

	<p>Along the water’s edge, obscured
	by the trees between,
	moved something black and huge,
	that shone wetly. Thwaite dropped
	to one knee and began firing at it,
	emptying the magazine.</p>

	<p>They pressed forward to the
	margin of the slough, feet squishing
	in the deep muck. Dalton
	played his flashlight on the water’s
	surface and the still-moving
	ripples seemed to reflect redly.</p>

	<p>Thwaite was first to break the
	silence. He said grimly, “Damned
	lucky for me you got here when
	you did. It—<em>had</em> me.”</p>

	<p>Dalton nodded without speaking.</p>

	<p>“But how did you know what
	to do?” Thwaite asked.</p>

	<p>“It wasn’t my discovery,” said
	the linguist soberly. “Our remote
	ancestors met this threat and invented
	a weapon against it. Otherwise
	man might not have survived.
	I learned the details from the
	Martian records when I succeeded
	in translating them. Fortunately
	the Martians also preserved a
	specimen of the weapon our ancestors
	invented.”</p>

	<p>He held up the little reed flute
	and the archeologist’s eyes
	widened with recognition.</p>

	<p>Dalton looked out across the
	dark swamp-water, where the
	ripples were fading out. “In the
	beginning there was the voice of
	evil—but there was also the
	music of good, created to combat
	it. Thank God that in mankind’s
	makeup there’s more than one
	fundamental note!”</p>
